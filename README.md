# Interactive-Web-Map
Interactive Web Map Created with Python and Folium

I used 2 datasets, one csv file representing all the volcanoes in the world (volcanoes2.csv) and another is a GeoJson File representing as polygons all the countries in the world (world.json)

Therefore, I created 2 layers (Volcanoes and Population) that can be turned on and off, and I also added a legend with branca for better comprehension.

When pressing on the volcanoes, we can get their name and height, when pressing on the countries, we can get their population

git clone https://github.com/lenapapuc/Interactive-Web-Map

The map can be opened by clicking on the map1.html file or with tools such as LiveServer
